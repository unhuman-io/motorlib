// Base class for encoders, which by default are used as position sensors for
// both a motor encoder and an output encoder. An encoder should be periodically
// polled by a control loop that will first call trigger() then read(). Calling
// the trigger function ahead of read is useful, for example, for starting a
// digital read and then allowing some time for processing and returning later
// to reap the results with read.
//
// The encoder should return a int32_t that incrementally counts and wraps at
// 2^31 to 2^-31. Additional code in the main and fast loops will ensure that
// this wrap does not cause a control discontinuity. It should never be updated
// in a way that causes a discontinuity after the first read. That is, the first
// read can return any integer value, such as in the case of an absolute
// encoder, but additonal reads should be incrementally accurate. The
// index_received() function is used to indicate precense of an index pulse
// received for an incremental encoder. It should be set to always true for an
// absolute encoder.
